# eye strain notifer
 [Windows] This script notifies the user every 20 minutes to look away from te screen.
 
## 20-20-20 rule
This program is based on the 20-20-20 rule which says that for every 20 minutes spent looking at a screen, a person should look at something 20 feet (~6 metres) away for 20 seconds. This is a good practise to reduce eye strain.
